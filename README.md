Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have revolutionized various industries with their versatility and efficiency. These small, remote-controlled aircraft are equipped with cameras, sensors, and GPS, making them ideal for tasks like aerial photography, surveillance, and delivery services. In agriculture, drones monitor crop health and optimize irrigation, while in construction, they survey sites and inspect structures. Emergency services use drones for search and rescue missions, providing real-time footage in hard-to-reach areas. Additionally, drones have become popular in recreational activities, offering stunning aerial views for photography enthusiasts.
